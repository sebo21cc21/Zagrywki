# GeoFence Unlocker

GeoFence Unlocker is a simple web application that uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to unlock specific content based on the user's location. The application displays a map with multiple geofenced zones. As the user enters one of the designated areas, corresponding content is automatically revealed.

## Features

  Displays two geofenced zones:
  - **Lotnisko w Chrcynnie:** A 20 km radius zone.
  - **Warszawa Nowy Åšwiat:** A 1 km radius zone.

- **Real-Time Location Tracking:**  
  Uses the browser's Geolocation API to continuously track the user's location.

- **Visual Feedback:**  
  Marks the user's current position with a blue marker and a small blue circle.

- **Content Unlocking:**  
  Reveals specific content when the user enters one of the geofenced areas.
